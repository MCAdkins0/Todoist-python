# Todoist-python

## Get your todos with Python
This is a basic Python application for me to fetch my tasks
Not for use by anyone other than me at this point, but I plan to change that.
Currently lets you fetch by project id

## To-Do
- Task info is stored in Json file, but it is not updated by syncing to Todoist, so they don't leave after you mark them complete
- Give a way to mark complete from the app
- Give way to edit from app
- Give way to create new tasks from app
